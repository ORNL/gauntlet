      Gauntlet (Geographic Augmentation of Extracted
      Building Features Tool) generates 65 measures of a
      buildingâ€™s morphology. These morphology features can
      be used for various classification tasks and modeling
      the built environment.

abstract: >-
  The purpose of Gauntlet is to generate 65 measurements
  from geospatial polygon data that describes the morphology
  of the polygons.


  Gauntlet is a single script (.py) in the /src folder. Only
  a few lines of code will need be modified, lines 204 -
  214. The data is required to have an unique id field and a
  polygon geometry field stored in a common geospatial data
  format (.shp, .gpkg, .geojson, .gdb/feature_class).
